        <h3>An exquisite-looking dish.</h3> 
        <p><b>Description: </b>The ham's sweetness is locked inside the fresh vegetables, drizzled with a spicy broth. Delicious is an understatement.</p>
        <p><b>Effect: </b><i>Increases all party members' ATK by 272 and CRIT Rate by 8% for 300s.</i></p>
        <p><b>Type: </b>ATK-Boosting Dishes</p>
        <p>Depending on the quality, Jade Parcels increases the party's attack by 224/272/320 and critical rate by 6/8/10% for 300 seconds. Like most foods, this has no effect for other players in Co-Op Mode.</p>
